####Introduction

The Iris flower data set first appeared in biologist Ronald Fisher's 1936 paper "The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems".  
Fisher's work has been highly influential in the fields of data science and machine learning over the decades since its publication and
has been referenced on innumerable occasions by teachers and academics.

Fisher's data set comprises a study of three different species of the Iris flower (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor)
